            <h2>Florida - Key West & Fort Lauderdale </h2>
            </br>
            Florida is the southeasternmost U.S. state, with the Atlantic
            on one side and the Gulf of Mexico on the other. It has hundreds
            of miles of beaches. The city of Miami is known for its Latin-American
            cultural influences and notable arts scene, as well as its nightlife, 
            especially in upscale South Beach. 
            Orlando is famed for theme parks, including Walt Disney World.

            </br>
            The Florida Keys are a string of tropical islands stretching about
            120 miles off the southern tip of the U.S. state of Florida, 
            between the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. 
            Theyâ€™re known as a destination for fishing, boating, snorkeling and 
            scuba diving.

        <h2>South Carolina - Charleston</h2>
        </br>
        Charleston, the South Carolina port city founded in 1670,
        is defined by its cobblestone streets, horse-drawn carriages
        and pastel antebellum houses, particularly in the elegant
        French Quarter and Battery districts.
        
        </br>
        The Battery promenade
        and Waterfront Park both overlook Charleston Harbor, 
        while Fort Sumter, a federal stronghold where the first shots
        of the Civil War rang out, lies across the water.

        <h2>Bahamas - Nassau</h2>
        </br>
        Nassau is the capital of the Bahamas. It lies on the island of
        New Providence, with neighboring Paradise Island accessible via 
        Nassau Harbor bridges. A popular cruise-ship stop, the city has 
        a hilly landscape and is known for beaches as well as its offshore 
        coral reefs, popular for diving and snorkeling.
        </br>
       
        It retains many of its typical pastel-colored British colonial buildings, like the 
        pink-hued Government House.
